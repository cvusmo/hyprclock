## Status

**Hyprclock** is currently in active development. The application is nearing its release, but I'm still adding features and refining its functionality. Stay tuned for updates! This is my first rust built widget as I'm new to the rust language. I'm not a professional software engineer, or programmer. I'm simply a nerd who enjoys learning.

1. Download the hyprclock-0.1.0a.tar.gz file from the Releases section of the hyprclock repository.

6. chmod +x hyprclock
7. ./hyprclock
8. Move to a directory such as /usr/local/bin
